## About

This project was built using the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/). I created the app based on the final project design provided by [Scrimba's React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=29689s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)

I also added dark mode and the ability to choose quiz category and/or difficulty.

I mostly used this project to learn how to implement:
- custom inputs (checkbox for dark mode and radio buttons for quiz answers)
- dark mode
